description: Triage and orient GitHub repository, pull request, and issue work through the connected GitHub app. Use when the user asks for general GitHub help, wants PR or issue summaries, or needs repository context before choosing a more specific GitHub workflow.

# GitHub

## Overview

Use this skill as the umbrella entrypoint for general GitHub work in this plugin.

Prefer the GitHub app from this plugin for repository, issue, pull request, comment, label, reaction, and PR creation workflows.

## Connector-First Responsibilities

Handle these directly in this skill:

- repository orientation once the repo, PR, issue, or local checkout is identified
- recent PR or issue triage
- PR metadata summaries
- PR patch inspection
- PR comments, labels, and reactions
- issue lookup and summarization
- PR creation after a branch is already pushed

Prefer the GitHub app from this plugin for those flows because it provides structured PR, issue, and review-adjacent data. If the repository is not already identifiable from the user request, ask for the repo instead of pretending there is a repo-search flow that may not exist.

## Routing Rules

1. Resolve the operating context first:
   - If the user provides a repository, PR number, issue number, or URL, use that.
   - If the request is about "this branch" or "the current PR", resolve local git context and use `gh` only as needed to discover the branch PR.
   - If the repository is still ambiguous after local inspection, ask for the repo identifier.
2. Classify the request before taking action:
   - `repo or PR triage`: summarize PRs, issues, patches, comments, labels, reactions, or repository state
   - `review follow-up`: unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline review feedback
   - `CI debugging`: failing checks, Actions logs, or CI root-cause analysis
   - `publish changes`: create or switch branches, stage changes, commit, push, and open a draft PR
3. Stay within the connected GitHub app for repository, issue, pull request, comment, label, reaction, and PR creation workflows.
4. If the request needs local checkout state, GitHub Actions logs, branch creation, committing, or pushing, explain that this plugin does not provide that local workflow by itself.

## Default Workflow

1. Resolve repository and item scope.
2. Gather structured PR or issue context through the GitHub app from this plugin.
3. Decide whether the task can be completed through the connected GitHub app.
4. If the work needs local Git or CI log access, state that boundary clearly.
5. End with a clear summary of what was inspected, what changed, and what remains.

## Output Expectations

- For triage requests, return a concise summary of the repository, PR, or issue state and the next likely action.
- For mixed requests, separate what the GitHub app can handle from what requires local Git or CI log access.
- For connector-backed write actions, restate the exact PR, issue, label, or reaction target before applying the change.
- Never imply that GitHub Actions logs are available through the connector alone. That remains a `gh` workflow.

## Examples

- "Use GitHub to summarize the open PRs in this repo and tell me what needs attention."
- "Help with this PR."
- "Review the latest comments on PR 482 and tell me what is actionable."
